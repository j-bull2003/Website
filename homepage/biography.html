        <p>My passion for coding sprouted at 13, taking original inspiration from my father who was passionate about the technologies field.
        I always enjoyed playing and messing around with code, however I only started to consider it a possible career option for me when I
        enrolled to study Computer Science at University in 2022.
        As a passionate and resolute young visionary, my motivation is to always strive for the best. I have
        the desire and open mind to work in a team or independently to do what is necessary to create a
        purposeful impact within the software industry. With my involvement and devotion, I believe I can
        dramatically advance not only the technologies sector but also my own personal pursuit within this limitless industry.</p>

        <h2 class="title">My Mission</h2 >

        <p>Enrolling in a STEM related discipline was simultaneously the most conspicuous and intimidating decision I've ever had to make; the lack of female visibility
        in our modern society surrounding women in ICT working environments has led to discouraging ideologies about women entering this field. Furthermore, according
        to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in 2022 a mere 18% of workers pursuing or involved in a computer science career were women whilst the respective 82% were men.
        This scarcity of inspiring female role models, coupled with a skewed perception of an aggressive male-dominated work environment are chief preventing factors for women
        to enter the sector. Specifically, by introducing new techniques and ways of thinking, I strive to remain at the forefront of technology's rapid advancement.
        With all factors considered, my goal is to increase the efficacy and value of women in STEM, by being an inspirational role model to females who may be considering
         a career in this sector.
